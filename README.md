# Time travelled measurement CNN

I used the [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) library that runs on top of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) to make a classifier for videos, it checks how long an object is moving before it collides with something else.

## Dependencies

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install all the required libraries through the requirements file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
